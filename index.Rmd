# Preface {-}

## What this book is about?  {-}

The book is a collection of tools and how-tos on how to perform tasks that a data scientist may encounter on a daily basis. 
This book will in part reflect my own experience (I come from economics/statistics background) on 
acquiring technical skills I will layout things that were not obvious to me, but may come natural for a computer scientist. Furthermore,
this book will cover a lot of concepts but won't go into great detail discussing them - it will teach you enough to
start doing simple yet very useful and powerful tools introduce concepts that can be then researched by the reader. Finally,
it will contain links and book recommendations for further reading and learning.
