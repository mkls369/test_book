<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Basic terminal commands</h2>
<p>This section will introduce the main commands you will need in your daily routine. I will use some
Windows analogies to illustrate how they can be used. Note that you should be careful when not only
deleting files, but also writing because your work can be overwritten.</p>
<div id="navigating-the-folders" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Navigating the folders</h3>
<p>After connecting to the remote computer you should land in your home folder. The terminal shows where you
are currently you shloud see a <code>~$</code> before your blinking cursor. Type <code>pwd</code> for print working directory
you should see <code>/home/your_username</code> printed after the command is executed. This is your home folder.</p>
<p>To know what’s in a folder type <code>ls</code> (for list). It might be empty and nothing will get printed. We
can go <em>up</em> one directory level to <code>/home</code> directory to check it out. Type <code>cd ..</code> in the command
prompt to do so. It is equivalant to Alt + ↑ or clicking the up arrow in the Windows File
Explorer navigation bar.</p>
<p>Type <code>ls</code> once more to see what’s inside this folder. You should see a list of folders with named after
usernames of this computer’s users. If there are many users the printing might seem cluttered and hard to read.
Try typing <code>ls -l</code> this outputs a much nicer table like output with folder names in the last column.
the <code>-l</code> after the <code>ls</code> command is a argument (sometimes also called a flag) it lists out the contents of
the folder in a Long File Format. Try googling for other arguments of the <code>ls</code> function - you will
be using it a lot - so it’s good to know what your options are.</p>
<p>Last thing to note that you navigate to folder by absolute path like <code>cd /home/your_username/</code> and
by relative path <code>cd your_username</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-and-folders-and-files-part-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Creating and folders and files, part 1</h3>
<p>I’m assuming you returned to your folder <code>/home/your_username/</code> and are ready to make some folder i.e.
directories. Conveniently this command is named <code>makedir</code>. Let’s type out <code>makedir new_folder</code> to create
a folder by that name and lets go inside it.</p>
<p>When creating files you have more options of commands. If you want create a short text file you can use
<code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> commands. Let’s type <code>echo "This is some text" &gt; new_file.txt</code> and then <code>ls</code> to check
if our file exists. Ok let’s break down what happens when you type the <code>echo ...</code> command.
The <code>echo</code> command writes the passed arguments (in out case the string <em>This is some text</em>)
to standard output (often shortened to <em>stdout</em>). Is one of the three standard streams of I/O the others
being stardard input (stdin) and standard error (stderr). These streams are plain text that can be
easily written or displayed. You have already passed command to standard input when typing and
executing commands in the interactive shell. You have also seen stdout in action when you invoked <code>ls</code>
commands. However, stdin and stdout should not be associated with terminal prompt and output (which
are inded the default options) they can be any file or even device and the standard streams can be
redirected as we will se below. Tthis explanation was longwinded but it will come in hand when
explaining the command.</p>
<p>The command <code>echo</code> writes the string “This is some text” to standard input. Let’s try the command
<code>echo "This is some text"</code> you should see your terminal outputting <em>This is some text</em>. This was to
be expected, right? Now the arrow <code>&gt;</code> is used to redirect the standard output to somewhere else in this
case it’s the file new_file.txt.</p>
</div>
<div id="viewing-file-contents-part-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Viewing file contents, part 1</h3>
<p>Now to see what’s inside the file you also have several options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>cat new_file.txt (cat is used to con<strong>cat</strong>tenate several files and then print to stdout but in
this case it is very useful to print single files)</li>
<li>less new_file.txt to read the file page by page</li>
<li>more new_file.txt to view the entire file’s contents</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="creating-folders-and-files-part-2-vim" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Creating folders and files, part 2 (VIM)</h3>
<p>I mentioned there are several option to create files. I think you can already see the limitations of
first approach, however let’s explore a few more thing before moving on to text editors.</p>
<p>It is important to know that <code>&gt;</code> will override any file try it with echo
<code>echo "This is some completely new text" &gt; new_file.txt</code> further limiting it’s usage. Thankfully, there is
a similar function <code>&gt;&gt;</code> that will keep adding lines to the end of the file leaving rest of it’s contents
intact: <code>echo "This is a new line" &gt;&gt; new_file.txt</code>. It comes very handing when collecting outputs from some
running program.</p>
<p>If have ever used a text editor like MS Word or LibreOffice Writer you should know powerful and easy
to use they are. The text editors discussed below are as powerful, however have steeper learning curve.
The reason you should have at least a basic command of at least one of them is often you will have no
other options to edit files on remote computers.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss VIM first. Why VIM? It’s quite popular according to a recent Stack Overflow <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools">survey</a> and
it might be available in your linux environment.</p>
<p>To start editing a file young VIM just type <code>vim new_vim_file.txt</code>. If it’s a new file you should see
<code>"new_vim_file.txt" [New File]</code> in the bottom left. The behavior of VIM can altered by switching it’s
modes, let’s discuss the main modes briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal mode (also called Command mode) this is mode you can execute commands in VIM. This is the
default mode when you open a file</li>
<li>Insert mode used to alter the file’s contents insert/write text</li>
<li>Visual mode lets you to select text like you would with a mouse</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go through a simple task in VIM: writing a line of text and saving the document. Assuming you
kept the file open press <code>a</code> or <code>i</code> key to go to insert mode. It should look something like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/insert_mode.png" alt="Insert mode" />
<p class="caption">Insert mode</p>
</div>
<p>You can type as normally now. Write something in like: This is a new line written in VIM. Now ‘save’
the file. First you need return to to Command mode by hitting <strong>Esc</strong> key
(you should see the – INSERT – vanish from the bottom left), now press <code>:</code> key and type w.
The prompt should look like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/write_file.png" alt="Write file" />
<p class="caption">Write file</p>
</div>
<p>Now press enter to execute the command. You should get a message <code>"new_vim_file.txt" 1L, 35C written</code>
mean you have just written 1L containing 35 characters. Now to quit the VIM program press <code>:</code>
and type q, press enter to execute the command (you could also could have gone with <code>:wq</code> to
write-and-quit in one go). If for some reason you don’t want to save the changes use <code>:q!</code> to quit
without saving.</p>
<p>There’s a pretty high change you’ll be navigating far larger text files that the one we’ve just created.
The following commands will help you navigating:</p>
<ul>
<li>h moves the cursor one character to the left.</li>
<li>l moves the cursor one character to the right.</li>
<li>j moves the cursor down one line.</li>
<li>k moves the cursor up one line.</li>
<li>0 moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.</li>
<li>$ moves the cursor to the end of the line.</li>
<li>w move forward one word.</li>
<li>b move backward one word.</li>
<li>G move to the end of the file.</li>
<li>gg move to the beginning of the file.
`. move to the last edit.</li>
</ul>
<p>A little explanation is needed on the <code>hjkl</code> you have probably already noticed that it’s possible to
achieve the same navigation with arrow case and as a bonus it also works in insert mode. As with many
trivialities in Computer Science world there is an ongoing discussion whether the <code>hjkl</code> or they arrow keys
should be used. In fact the arrow keys are superior to the <code>hjkl</code> because the can be used in conjunction with
Ctrl to jump across individual words. You don’t have to use them because someone told you so without
justifying the motivation.</p>
<p>VIM has a lot of keyboard-shortcuts and they will discussed here you can look at or even print out
<strong>cheatsheets</strong> like <a href="https://vim.rtorr.com/">this</a> to practise using them. I suggest looking at
<em>Cut and paste</em> and <em>Search and replace</em> sections first. VIM does not have the most intuitive if UIs and
takes some time to master. Try learning it bit by bit and testing out new things in a toy environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="deleting-files-and-folders" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Deleting files and folders</h3>
<p>To delete a file simply use the <code>rm</code> command followed with the file name like <code>rm new_vim_file.txt</code>.
Be careful when deleting files - the action is irreversible It is smart to select the files first
before deleting them to make sure you are deleting you want to delete. This is especially important
when deleting multiple files. First let’s learn how to make multiple files. We will use <code>touch</code> command
along with the brace expansion <code>touch file{1..10}.txt</code>. <code>touch</code> can create empty files, but it is
usually used to modify the timestamp of a file. Let’s look at the folder - you should see ten new files
named <code>file1.txt</code> to <code>file10.txt</code>. Let’s say what we like the file <code>file10.txt</code> but want to delete
the others. We could do the <code>rm</code> operation 9 times on each individual file, but it wouldn’t be a
good use of out time would it? We can optimize the procedure by using wildcards. If you are familiar
with regex you should know what <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> stand for. If not <code>*</code> - match any symbol(s) i.e. one
or more and <code>?</code> will match a single any symbol. Let’s try them out by listing our files:
<code>ls file*.txt</code> should output all the file names we have created, It is very natural because the <code>*</code>
(we can refer to it as <strong>glob</strong>) matches the first number for the files <code>file1.txt</code> to <code>file9.txt</code>
and it also matches the 0 for <code>file10.txt</code>. But what if we used the question mark? <code>ls file?.txt</code>
should show you only files <code>file1.txt</code> to <code>file9.txt</code> because it match a character a single time.
We know know how deletion will work and we’re not afraid to use it let’s do <code>rm file*.txt</code>. You can see
the file <code>file10.txt</code> is the only one left. You could point that it was very convinient for us to leave
the double digit file, but there are other matching capabilities, say we needed to delete files
<code>file6.txt</code> to <code>file10.txt</code> we could have used the same brace expansion: <code>rm file{6..10}.txt</code> to delete them.</p>
<p>Deleting folder is not that different, just remember that <strong>all</strong> of their contents will be deleted
along, we just have to pass along a <code>-r</code> flag to delete them: <code>rm -r my_folder</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="copying-moving-files-and-folders" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.6</span> Copying, moving files and folders</h3>
<p>Copying is achieved with <code>cp</code> command and the following syntax <code>cp my_file_location the_copy_file_location</code>
You can also copy multiple files just make sure to include the wildcards for both file groups.</p>
<p>Moving a file can be done with <code>mv</code>: <code>mv file_to_move new_location_of_file</code>. This command is also used for renaming files.</p>
<p>Copying/moving folders is not different.</p>
<p>Finally, you will often want to transfer between computers then you should use <code>scp</code>. The following
will let you copy files from the remote machine to yours while you are on the local machine:
<code>scp remote_username@remote.ip.adderess:/remote/path/to/file.txt /home/local_username/file.txt</code>
reverse the two arguments to copy from your local machine to remote. The syntax will work
if you are on remote computer just be aware what machine you are operating.</p>
<p>We are done with basic linux commands and will introduce some new ones later. You should have a
good grasp of creating/deleting/editing/moving/copying files and folders.</p>
